### Roadmap for Building Genomic Epidemiology Capacity
Weâ€™ve developed a roadmap of what expertise, capabilities, and infrastructure is necessary to support sustained, routine application of pathogen genomics to public health questions. These are the **essential elements** necessary to support effective genomic surveillance and actionable genomic epidemiological inferences. 

Access the full Essential Elements Roadmap document [here](Essential%20Elements%20Roadmap.pdf).
